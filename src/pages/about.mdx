# About

## Desciption

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge by Eric Wastl. Some take up the
challenge for the glory of the hall of fame. Others, like me, use the daily
puzzles as a way of learning a new language.

And so, this project has been the story of my journey into Python - the
language, the ecosystem and the whole Pythnoic world. Blended with years
of experience as a Software Engineer, the aim is to compose solutions that
are elegant, robust and fully tested. Oh, and deployed as a RESTful API
on AWS Lambda, with Github Actions providing for a full CI/CD pipleline
with automated test, build and deploy functionality.

Developing the project further, I decided to create this website to
showcase my work and to delve deeper into learning the React Next.js
framework with a Mantine UI backed by a MDX page source.
