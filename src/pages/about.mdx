## About

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding challenge by
[Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). Some take up the challenge for the glory of the
hall of fame. Others, like me, use the daily puzzles as a way of learning a new
language. And so, this project is the story of my journey into
[Python](https://www.python.org/) - the language, the ecosystem and the whole
Pythnoic world. Blended with years of experience as a Software Engineer, the aim
is to compose solutions that are elegant, robust and fully tested. Oh, and
deployed as a RESTful API using [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/),
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), with
[Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) providing for a CI/CD
pipleline with automated test, build and deploy functionality. Free to try it
out below, just don't spoil your fun by using the API until you've solved the
puzzle by yourself!!!
