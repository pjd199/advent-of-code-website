### /

A list of puzzle solutions, listed by year and day

For example,
[https://jnrxshzkvnbexzeedxptq54ugq0mqlpe.lambda-url.eu-west-2.on.aws/](https://jnrxshzkvnbexzeedxptq54ugq0mqlpe.lambda-url.eu-west-2.on.aws/)

```json
{
  "years": [
    {
      "days": [
        1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
        21, 22, 23, 24, 25
      ],
      "year": 2015
    },
    {
      "days": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
      "year": 2016
    }
  ]
}
```

### /\{year}

A list of puzzles which have been solved for the requested year.

For example,
[https://jnrxshzkvnbexzeedxptq54ugq0mqlpe.lambda-url.eu-west-2.on.aws/2015](https://jnrxshzkvnbexzeedxptq54ugq0mqlpe.lambda-url.eu-west-2.on.aws/2015)

```json
{
  "days": [
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
    22, 23, 24, 25
  ],
  "year": 2015
}
```

### /\{year}/\{day}

Solve the puzzle for the requested year and day. There are three options for
providing the puzzle input.

1. The URL of a puzzle input file can be passed in using the input query
   parameter when requesting with the HTTP GET method, i.e. append
   ?input=http... to request URL
2. The puzzle input file can be uploaded using the HTTP POST method.
3. If no puzzle input is provided, the author's puzzle input is used by default.

For example,
[https://jnrxshzkvnbexzeedxptq54ugq0mqlpe.lambda-url.eu-west-2.on.aws/2015/1](https://jnrxshzkvnbexzeedxptq54ugq0mqlpe.lambda-url.eu-west-2.on.aws/2015/1)

```json
{
  "day": 1,
  "title": "Not Quite Lisp",
  "part_one": "74",
  "part_two": "1795",
  "year": 2015
}
```

### /\{year}/\{day}/part_one

As above, but only solves part one of the puzzle.

For example,
[https://jnrxshzkvnbexzeedxptq54ugq0mqlpe.lambda-url.eu-west-2.on.aws/2015/1/part_one](https://jnrxshzkvnbexzeedxptq54ugq0mqlpe.lambda-url.eu-west-2.on.aws/2015/1/part_one)

```json
{
  "day": 1,
  "title": "Not Quite Lisp",
  "part_one": "74",
  "year": 2015
}
```

### /\{year}\{day}/part_two

As above, but only solves part two of the puzzle.

For example,
[https://jnrxshzkvnbexzeedxptq54ugq0mqlpe.lambda-url.eu-west-2.on.aws/2015/1/part_two](https://jnrxshzkvnbexzeedxptq54ugq0mqlpe.lambda-url.eu-west-2.on.aws/2015/1/part_two)

```json
{
  "day": 1,
  "title": "Not Quite Lisp",
  "part_two": "1795",
  "year": 2015
}
```
