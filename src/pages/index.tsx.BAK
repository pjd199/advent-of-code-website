        &nbsp;is an annual coding challenge by Eric Wastl. Some take up the
        challenge for the glory of the hall of fame. Others, like me, use the
        daily puzzles as a way of learning a new language.

        And so, this project has been the story of my journey into Python - the
        language, the ecosystem and the whole Pythnoic world. Blended with years
        of experience as a Software Engineer, the aim is to compose solutions
        that are elegant, robust and fully tested. Oh, and deployed as a RESTful
        API using Flask, AWS Lambda, with Github Actions providing for a CI/CD
        pipleline with automated test, build and deploy functionality.

        Developing the project further, I've now added in a website builit in
        React and Next.js, with a Mantine UI - all to aid in the learning of new
        things.
