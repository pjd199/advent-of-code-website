# Welcome

[Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com) is an annual coding challenge by
Eric Wastl. Some take up the challenge for the glory of the hall of fame.
Others, like me, use the daily puzzles as a way of learning a new language.

And so, this project has been the story of my journey into Python - the
language, the ecosystem and the whole Pythnoic world. Blended with years of
experience as a Software Engineer, the aim is to compose solutions that are
elegant, robust and fully tested. Oh, and deployed as a RESTful API AWS Lambda,
with Github Actions providing for a full CI/CD pipleline with automated test,
build and deploy functionality.

Developing the project further, I decided to create this website to showcase my
work and to delve deeper into learning the React Next.js framework with a
Mantine UI backed by a MDX page source.

Enjoy ;-)
